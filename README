Overview
--------

Tackle is a library and set of tools that let a user configure any
web server (Apache, IIS7, NGinx) using a single interface -- you no longer
need to learn the specific configuration commands of a given server to
make it do what you want it to do.

Tackle can be used as a static configuration store: just distribute the
.tackle file along with the library in your projects and you (and your
users) can generate the standard configuration files .htaccess, web.config,
and NGinx directives directly from the .tackle file.

Tackle can also be used a library to manipulate server configurations in
real time directly from your software. For example, a project may wish to
only expose to the outside world the files that it should see (instead of
making everything visible as many CMSes do) and tell the web server that
access to a newly created file is now allowed. The resulting software will
run consistently no matter which server it is currently running under.
